This Project took 11 Days to Complete. June 18, 2025 to June 29, 2025

Updates have continued afterwards so improvements may still come at any time.

This app was originally based on another app from the microsoft store, but it was taken down hence I recreated it myself along with some personal touches and improvements.

How it works:

You create events that appear as tiles with countdowns to your selected date.

You can create an event by pressing the blue button with a plus sign on it.

It will bring up a small menu just above the plus button, you can put a name, a date, a custom image, and 2 extra options.

The two extra options that are seen as checkboxes are as follows, the first one is "Count Up" which is for when your tile reaches zero/"the intended date" instead of the numbers disappearing(default) it will show how long its been since the selected date-- counting upwards.
The second option has sort of become redundant as of "Update 5" because the numbers and words did not have an outline, meaning it was harder to read in specific custom images, it would make the text black instead of white which could be helpful for brighter images, it may be removed in the future but for now its just a option if people want it.

Below the Plus Button is the Edit Mode Button, when you press it a Red X/Delete Button will appear on every tile, but also any tile you click on will bring up a Edit Menu for that tile, it looks almost Identical to the Create Menu.

Thats pretty much everything, its a pretty basic app and easy to use.

If you dont see why you would use it, well I will tell you personally I like to use it for Movies and TV Shows so I can see how much longer until things come out.

Importing and Exporting:

All tiles are saved in a countdown.json file and custom images are saved in a folder named tile_images located at the directory below.

C:\Users\ "user" \AppData\Roaming\EventCountdowns 

For a shortcut to get to the roaming folder you can type %appdata% into the windows search bar.
